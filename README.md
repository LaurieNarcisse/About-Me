### About Me

Hi there! I'm a results-oriented Technical Project Manager, Business Analyst, and Technical Support professional with a passion for driving project success and collaborating with diverse teams. I thrive on leveraging emerging technologies to achieve project goals and enjoy the challenge of resolving issues efficiently.

My academic journey includes a Master's in Data Science from Western Governors University and a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems from Florida Atlantic University. Throughout my career, I've honed my skills in a variety of tools and technologies, including Python, SQL, Java, and software suites like Adobe CS5.5 and Microsoft Office. I'm well-versed in Agile project management methodologies and adept at transforming complex data into actionable insights.

On a more personal note, I'm an avid traveler and an enthusiastic artist. Whether I'm exploring new places or sketching in my free time, I find inspiration in the world around me. I also share my home with Oliver, my lovable dog, who keeps life interesting and joyful.

I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills and expertise starting June 2024. If my profile resonates with you, please feel free to reach out. I'm open to relocation and excited about the possibilities ahead!

Let's connect and see how we can collaborate to achieve great things together!
